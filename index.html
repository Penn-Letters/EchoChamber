          <h2 class="title">ReadMe</h2>
          <div class="meta">August 21, 2025</div>
          <p>  The majority of these first posts are going to be rewrites of thoughts that I had briefly and rudimentarily jotted down in my Notes app. Almost all of these ideas are my own, save a few. And I will try to give due credit when presenting an idea or quote that's not mine. Some inspiration for these writgins struck while high, some not. They're simply a collection of thoughts I deemed worthy of doumentation, for whatever reason. While many ideas were created sober, I will be toasted while writing most of them down.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Post 1 - Differently Anchored Realities</h2>
          <div class="meta">August 21, 2025</div>
          <p>  It's both very interesting and unnoticed how each of us has a different reality from each other in slightly different ways. Ways that are completely subjective and hardly noticed consciously. For example, I think I view the world given everything is represented by the people within my view. That's where I keep myself without thinking about it, "In the middle of this group and that group of people." While some people anchor within the buildings around them in a similar way. Other people see the world through the lens of subconscious thought that they're taller than they are. Some are shorter. Some more NPC-like. Whatever. I noticed this because I am traditionally anchored with people but switch to location anchor when high. The most interesting thing is that the location anchor can change the most within subgroups. Like anchored based on the footpath, or the light up ahead, etc. In any case, this is an old idea: "Reality changes based on your interpretation/perception of surroundings." But it's cool to see it represented so physically. One of the coolest parts about being high is the ability to manipulate this so effectively. It's just all inherently subjective. Change it at will to what you like.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Post 2 - Hate the Output, Not the Activity</h2>
          <div class="meta">August 21, 2025</div>
          <p>  I will never dislike myself when opening a reel from a friend, starting the PC to play Skyrim, watching a show because I care about the plot, or even eating the trashiest food if I want THAT taste. I'll be fine afterwards and won't regret the choice in the slightest. The danger comes when I open reels, play games, turn the TV on, or eat junk because of instinct or because I want to feel distracted, engrossed, or stimulated. That's when it becomes garbage that I need to hate. Then these things stop becoming tools to use in life and instead become horse blinders to distract me from life. Everything is fine in moderation. Always ensure that your moderation is measured in necessity, not desire. </p>
